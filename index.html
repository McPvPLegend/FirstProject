    <p>HCPD is an advanced roleplay roblox game, with many ranks. These ranks start from Police Oficer, to the Cheif of Police. (Only MiroValor has this rank) The LR ranks are Police Oficer, 
      constable, seargant, Corpral, and Leuitenient. The MR ranks are Captain, Major, Colonel, and Commander. Commander is a rank that you need to get to get through your divison. The HR ranks are a little more advanced, but I
      will give you a baisc rank order. Superintendent, Chief Superintendent, Deputy Inspector of (TDU, ASU, TU, or SWAT), Inspector of TDU, ASU, TU, or SWAT, Deputy Chieff, Asistant Chief, and Chief of Police

    <h2>ASU</h2>

    <br>
    <p>ASU has the most responsability over all divisons aside from HQ. Its main priority is the checkpoint and protection of the Academy. ASU is allowed to authorize people, and make people "Kill on Site." ASU
      Also has the most control at the checkpoint aside from HQ as always. ASU is the hardest working divison, aside from HQ, our quota is 1 hour thirty minutes. That is the largest quota through the divisons! The ASU ranks are
      Pending Applicant, Secuirty Authorized, Security Superivosr, Security Instructor, Deputy Inspector of ASU, and Inspector of ASU. I leave out the Operations Oficers because their placement is a little different.

    <h2>TDU</h2>
    <br>
    <image src="Recources/Photos/TDU_LOGO.png" alt="TDU logo"/>
    <br>
    <p>TDU is a more advanced divison. It is not able to go to the checkpoint, but stil has a very important role within HCPD. They do Basic Training Tryouts, this lets recruits join HCPD as a Police Oficer. If they are a senior instructor, they can host LR trainings, so somebody below Leuitenient can be promoted. Senior instructors also have a dicipline role. If they are a senior, they tend to be a game moderator, meaning they can dicipline people through report tickets. This can include demotion, suspension, discharge, or blacklist if given by HQ memeber. Their rank system goes like this: trainee instructor, instructor, senior instrucor, Deputy Inspector of TDU, Inspector of TDU.</p>
