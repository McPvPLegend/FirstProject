    <p>HCPD is an advanced roleplay roblox game, with many ranks. These ranks start from Police Oficer, to the Cheif of Police. (Only MiroValor has this rank) The LR ranks are Police Oficer, 
      constable, seargant, Corpral, and Leuitenient. The MR ranks are Captain, Major, Colonel, and Commander. Commander is a rank that you need to get to get through your divison. The HR ranks are a little more advanced, but I
      will give you a baisc rank order. Superintendent, Chief Superintendent, Deputy Inspector of (TDU, ASU, TU, or SWAT), Inspector of TDU, ASU, TU, or SWAT, Deputy Chieff, Asistant Chief, and Chief of Police

    <br>
    <p>ASU has the most responsability over all divisons aside from HQ. Its main priority is the checkpoint and protection of the Academy. ASU is allowed to authorize people, and make people "Kill on Site." ASU
      Also has the most control at the checkpoint aside from HQ as always. ASU is the hardest working divison, aside from HQ, our quota is 1 hour thirty minutes. That is the largest quota through the divisons! The ASU ranks are
      Pending Applicant, Secuirty Authorized, Security Superivosr, Security Instructor, Deputy Inspector of ASU, and Inspector of ASU. I leave out the Operations Oficers because their placement is a little different.
