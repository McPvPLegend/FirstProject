        <p>The videos above were captured with Nvidida Ansel (Highlights). They are embemed with a site called <a href=https://streamable.com>streamable</a>. It lets me upload low resolution videos for free. A handy tool when trying to make a website that works on all computers (using pure HTML coding not 3rd party software) </p>
